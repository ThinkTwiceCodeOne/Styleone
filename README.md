# Styleone
It's a J2EE project which will perform CRUD Operation

In this Project I write code in very old style. Those who knows about PrintWriter in JAVA to send back page to client Side. In Styletwo I'll be updating the code and introduce JSP to remove PrintWriter dependency.

Records are for testing purpose
